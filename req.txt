Example n8n Setup
1. Webhook Node (Teacher Upload)

Method: POST

URL: http://localhost:5678/webhook/teacher-upload

This will accept fields:

subject

topic

file (multipart/form-data)

2. HTTP Request Node → Ingest Service

Method: POST

URL: http://host.docker.internal:9002/ingest (use host.docker.internal if n8n is running in Docker)

Send body: Pass through subject, topic, file from webhook.

3. Notify Teacher

Email or Slack node:
“✅ Ingestion complete for {{subject}} → {{topic}}. Stored {{chunks}} chunks in ChromaDB.”

📂 Data Organization in Chroma

Each subject/topic pair = separate collection:

physics_thermodynamics

math_algebra

history_ww2

Each collection has nodes like:

{
  "id": "uuid-123",
  "text": "The first law of thermodynamics states...",
  "metadata": {
    "subject": "Physics",
    "topic": "Thermodynamics",
    "filename": "thermodynamics.txt"
  }
}


✅ With this, your teacher → n8n → ingestion service → ChromaDB pipeline is working.
Next step, we’ll add the /ask endpoint (FastAPI RAG) for students to query.
