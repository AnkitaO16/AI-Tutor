Thermodynamics is the branch of physics that deals with the relationships between heat and other forms of energy.
The first law of thermodynamics states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred or converted from one form to another.
The second law of thermodynamics states that the total entropy of an isolated system can never decrease over time.
